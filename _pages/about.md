I currently work as a Senior Staff Cloud Infrastructure Engineer at SentinelOne in Boulder, Colorado. Previously, I worked with companies like Twitter, Societe Generale, Intel, and NTT Data. Apart from my work, I am actively working on solving problems in multi-party intelligent negotiation in Multi-agent Systems and their applications in Cloud Computing. 

I have a master's degree in Computer Science (Distributed Systems) from Rutgers University where I also worked as <a href='teaching'>a part-time lecturer</a>.

Although I live in Boulder, I also call Toronto as my home. In my free time, I am either out on a road trip or hiking in and around Colorado.
